      <h1>License</h1>
    

    <p>Isotope may be used in commercial projects and applications with the one-time purchase of a commercial license.</p>

<h3 id='open_source_license'>Open source license</h3>

<p>For non-commercial, personal, or open source projects and applications, you may use Isotope under the terms of the MIT License. You may use Isotope for free.</p>

<h3 id='what_is_commercial_considered'>What is commercial considered?</h3>

<p>If you are paid to do your job, and part of your job is implementing Isotope, a commercial license is required.</p>

<h2 id='commercial_licensing'>Commercial licensing</h2>

<p>Purchasing accepts most credit cards and takes seconds. Once purchased, you&#8217;ll receive a commercial license PDF and you will be all set to use Isotope in your commercial applications.</p>

<p>With the purchase of a commercial license:</p>

<ul>
<li>You may use Isotope in as many commercial applications you like.</li>

<li>You may use Isotope in your own commercial applications and products. For example: premium WordPress, Tumblr, or other CMS themes, plugins and templates.</li>

<li>Customers and users of your products do <strong>not</strong> need to purchase their own license &#8211; so long as they are not developing their own commercial products with Isotope.</li>
</ul>

<p>The commercial license comes in two varieties:</p>

<h3 id='isotope_commercial_developer_license'>Isotope Commercial Developer License</h3>

<p>The Isotope Commercial Developer License is for individual developers. This license is priced per developer. Each individual developer needs to purchase a separate license. A developer is someone who implements Isotope, and probably types <code>.isotope()</code> at some point.</p>
<p><a href='https://www.simplegoods.co/i/WFOLIVJF' class='simple-goods-btn'>Buy Developer License - $25.00</a>
</p>
<h3 id='isotope_commercial_organization_license'>Isotope Commercial Organization License</h3>

<p>The Isotope Commercial Organization License is for an organization with a team of developers. The license covers the entire team no matter how many developers are working on it.</p>
<p><a href='https://www.simplegoods.co/i/NWONVKMO' class='simple-goods-btn'>Buy Organization License - $90.00</a>
</p>
<h2 id='isotope_commercial_license_agreement'>Isotope Commercial License Agreement</h2>

<h4 id='organization_grant'>Organization Grant</h4>

<p>The Isotope Commercial Organization License grants 1 license for your Organization as 1 designated, collective user (<strong>Organization</strong>) to use the Software for the purpose of developing Applications.
